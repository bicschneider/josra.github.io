title:  Return of the Memory Map plugin
author: Thierry Lacour
---

__It’s back... and it’s stronger than ever.__

With the upcoming release of the Memory Map plugin on the horizon, it’s time to get giddy at the upcoming improvements!

Chief among them is the added support for the [GCC compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/). With the new version also ships the ability of creating multiple graphs per parser, making it easier to keep track of your memory use in an orderly fashion.

As a result, the plugin configuration looks a bit different now, but no worries, your jobs are safe. The update is backwards compatible and your older plugin configurations will be migrated automatically.

For the full change log for the upcoming release, check the [Memory Map plugin Wiki](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Memory+Map+Plugin).

_The release is planned to go out shortly!_
