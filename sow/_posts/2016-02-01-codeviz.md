### Goal statement

The overall goal of this work is to create a tool for generating html visualizations
of code metrics.  As a proof-of-concept, the first visualization would be to create treemap graphs of csv data like in this example:

![Code complexity metrics for git](/images/metrics.png)

Here are the main requirements:

Input file: a csv file containing filepath, LOC, metric.

Example complexity metrics file:

````
File,LOC,Complexity
a/b/c/file.c,80,12
a/b/exception.c,454,25
````
The output graph will have the following characteristics:

  * The smallest boxes in the treemap represents single files
  * The size of a file box represents its size in term of lines of code (i.e. big files are displayed larger than small files)
  * The files are organized into folder boxes
  * You can 'drill-down' into a particular directory
  * You can specify color ranges for the metric display

### Suggested solution

The solution and implementation will include:

  - A program to generate the correct html/javascript page for a given csv file
  - The output will be suitable for static websites and for publishing in jenkins
  - Usage documentation
  - Unit tests
  - A continuous delivery pipeline for the software

### Estimated workload

The estimated workload for this task is 40 hours.

### Deliverables

A working program, complete with usage documentation and tests.
