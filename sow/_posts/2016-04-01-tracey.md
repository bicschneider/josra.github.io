### Goal statement

Develop middleware to enable tool-agnostic end to end traceability within Continuous Delivery pipeline and allow creation of real-time visualisation/statistical tools based on info provided by the middleware

### Feature

* Ability to measure lead time from source code commit to release of the software product
* Ability identify all source code changes together with corresponding work items and 3pp components included into product release, i.e. ability to trace down from product release to source code change
* Ability to identify all product releases that include source code change, i.e. ability to trace up from source code change to product release.

### Suggested solution

Proposed solution consists of several parts

* Database to store info about continuous delivery pipelines and events. We propose to use Neo4j database since this database is a graph-oriented database and continuous delivery pipeline is nothing else than acyclic directed graph.
* Middleware to deliver info from information producers to the database from where it will be available for the further processing by statistical and visualisation tools. We propose to use RabbitMQ message broker. In this way, we can build a scalable distributed system that will be able to accommodate setups of all sizes from small one-repository products to the multi-stage multi-components enterprise grade products.
* Information aggregator. We need a service that can receive info about events happening in continuous delivery pipelines and then translate them into the data format used to store them in the database. At this point, we are not aware of open source solution that is capable of implementing such functionality so we will have to develop it ourselves.
* Adaptors for information sources. We need to provide a possibility for information producers to send info to the message broker. At this stage, we will implement only plugin for Jenkins that will allow sending messages to RabbitMQ so the information aggregator could process them and then store in the database. There is existing RabbitMQ plugins that we can use to build upon and save development time https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/RabbitMQ+Consumer+Plugin

POC of proposed solution https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xqFa1AV21c
POC features message based triggering which is outside of scope for this SoW

### Implementation scope

* Information aggregator. We need to develop simple service capable of receiving messages and writing them to Neo4j. Service should be stateless so it can be implemented as a pool of worker in order to ensure scalability. The messaging protocol should also support asynchronous writing if possible.
* Jenkins plugin. Create Groovy based DSL to send messages so DSL commands are available for BuildFlow, Groovy build step,  Pipeline.
The plugin should reuse extension points of on RabbitMQ Consumer Plugin if possible. Also, we should be able to allow users to define their messages as well as modify a content of predefined messages.

Architecual details desribed in the README.md

### Workload

Estimated workload is 80 hours

### Deliverables

Alfa version of Jenkins plugin, information aggregator, documentation, tests, rockered demo setup. The aim is to produce usable version of the plugin so the concept is accessible for others to try and contribute
